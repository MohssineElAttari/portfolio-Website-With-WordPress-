**FAQ**
*Will this Starter Site plugin work with my theme?
The starter sites are built using Sydney and Airi. We suggest picking your favourite and using that. 
*Are there any FREE starter sites?
You will get several FREE pre-made websites. There are many more premium starters that can be accessed when you purchase our PRO version.
*Can I import a starter site on an existing website?
It is recommended to install and import a website demo on a fresh WordPress installation or a blank website to avoid overriding settings and page design. However, a page template can be imported on an existing website as well.
*Do I need to install any other plugin before importing a starter site?
All you need to do is install the Starter Sites plugin and select the website demo you wish to import. This step will install and activate the necessary plugins.
*Will you add more starter sites?
Yes, of course! We are working on many more free and pro starter demos built using Elementor.

**Happy Building!**
